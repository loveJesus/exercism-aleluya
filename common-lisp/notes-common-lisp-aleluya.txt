        - acons http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_acons.htm) to construct them (or just use list and cons if you'd rather)
        - use assoc (http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_assocc.htm) to look up a key in the associatino list.


# NOTES_ALELUYA
- No while loops
- Cannot iterate over strings, they are sequences, use get
- can do (or a b) to use b if a is nil
- can do loop, when, setq setf if etc.
- mapcar zips lists also
- loop is capable, http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/loop-for-black-belts.html
- no return (like with a body with a when that is not entered) returns nil
- existence of associative lists, cdr is second item
