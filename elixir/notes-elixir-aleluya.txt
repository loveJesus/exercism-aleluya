# NOTES_ALELUYA: 
 - \W regexp and german words
 - ternary if true, do: 1, else: 0
 - Sort of rubyish, no let for variables
 - can do value_aleluya = maybenillvar_aleluya || defaultvalue_aleluya
 - Map.get default value, Map.update for defaults, multiple function signatures
 - %{mapvarleluya | paramleluya: newvaleluya} to update
 - uses case as the switch statement
 - put end at the end of lambdas with only fn aleluya -> at start
 - Can have functions with same arity, match different params (see word-count hallelujah)
 - Use when n_aleluya in [a_aleluya, b_aleluya] as guard in case or fn
