For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, 
that all who believe in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

----------------
Psalm 133, 6/4, 107 BPM

- The song has 5 verses of 6 bars each, 
with an A part and B part of 3 bars each

- A parts have ~5 syllables, B parts have ~7

- The Chord switches at the last syllable,
which sort of glides upwards
and is held for a long time.

- Chord progression is 
 A part: D->Amin, 
 B part: Bb->G (and almost glides into Amaj)
 You can see the / where the switch happens
 This switch happens two bars into each part

- Structure reminiscent of Bj√∂rk, glory to God
and we pray for her to be a sister in Christ Jesus

------
A: How good how plea/sant
B: bro-thers dwe-lling in un/ity

A: like oil fragra/nt
B: up-on the head down the b/eard

A: the beard of Ar/on
B: to the edges of his r/obes

A: like dew of herm/on
B: down the moun-tains of zi/on

A: for there the Lo/rd
B: co-man-ded life for ev/er
